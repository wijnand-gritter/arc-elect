# ðŸš€ Unified Improvement Plan: Arc Elect JSON Schema Editor

_Last updated: 2025-08-04_

## ðŸŸ¥ CRITICAL (BLOCKERS â€“ Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Resolve TypeScript Compilation Errors

- Fix all TypeScript errors:
  - Address `unknown` type propagation (replace with interfaces and type guards)
  - Correct `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` violations (add null/undefined checks)
  - Fix RefObject/type mismatches in components/hooks
  - Implement all missing IPC methods referenced in code
- Use `tsc --noEmit` and enforce 0 errors in CI.

### 2. Implement Comprehensive Testing

- Add **unit tests** for services, hooks, and business logic
- Add **integration tests** for major workflows (project create, load, save, schema edit)
- Add **E2E/smoke tests** for critical user flows
- Set a minimum coverage threshold (e.g. 80%) and enforce in CI

### 3. Decompose and Refactor Large Components/Files

- Break up any file over 1,000 lines (e.g. `Build.tsx`, `MonacoEditor.tsx`, `project-manager.ts`)
  - Each should follow single responsibility principle
  - Extract business logic, state management, and heavy config into modules
- Split large functions (e.g. `createProject`) into focused helpers

### 4. Fix Memory Leaks and Resource Cleanup

- Ensure **file watchers** are always cleaned up on project deletion or shutdown
- Audit all async functions/hooks for proper cancellation and cleanup
- Fix potential memory leaks (especially in `useEffect` hooks and long-lived components)

---

## ðŸŸ§ HIGH PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

### 5. Strengthen Error Handling and Recovery

- Use `safeAsyncHandler` (or equivalent) to wrap all async operations
- Add error boundaries to all critical React component trees
- Display user-friendly error messages; log technical details only internally
- Implement retry/error recovery logic for likely-to-fail operations (file IO, async loads)
- Audit for unhandled promise rejections

### 6. Enhance Type Safety and Data Validation

- Replace all `unknown` types in IPC handlers with explicit interfaces
- Validate all IPC and external data (add runtime validation/type guards)
- Implement comprehensive file path validation (traversal prevention, malicious input filtering, absolute path checks)

### 7. Optimize React Performance

- Add `React.memo` to all list and frequently-rendered components
- Implement virtualization for large lists
- Use granular selectors in Zustand store to minimize re-renders
- Audit/add `useCallback` and `useMemo` where beneficial

### 8. Bundle Size and Load Time Optimization

- **Code split** and **lazy load** heavy dependencies (e.g. Monaco Editor, Ajv)
- Only load non-critical features when necessary
- Audit dependencies for tree-shaking opportunities

### 9. Security Hardening

- Enforce `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false` in Electron
- Minimize the API surface of the preload script (expose only required APIs)
- Enforce IPC input validation everywhere
- Add rate limiting or access controls to sensitive IPC endpoints

---

## ðŸŸ¨ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Following Releases)

### 10. Code Organization and Readability

- Extract all magic numbers to named constants (e.g. `SCHEMA_LOAD_BATCH_SIZE`)
- Move detailed performance logging to a dedicated module
- Standardize function/variable naming conventions (align with style guide)
- Refactor for consistent naming in async/sync pairs, handlers, etc.

### 11. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

- Add detailed documentation for all complex modules and business logic
- Create architecture decision records
- Add inline comments for non-obvious code sections

### 12. Performance Monitoring

- Add production-ready performance metrics collection (dashboard/report)
- Avoid overly granular metrics that could impact runtime
- Move emoji/log-heavy performance reports to separate utilities

### 13. Error Message Improvements

- Review all user-facing errors for clarity and non-disclosure of internals
- Ensure logs are technical, user messages are actionable and clear

---

## ðŸŸ© LOW PRIORITY (Ongoing / As Capacity Allows)

- Continue refactoring for separation of concerns (business logic vs UI)
- Review and improve accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- Remove dead code, empty files, and obsolete configs
- Add cross-module documentation and onboarding notes
- Consider circuit breaker patterns for any unstable external dependencies

## ðŸ“‹ Sample Sprint Breakdown

### Sprint 1 (BLOCKERS)

- [ ] Resolve all TypeScript errors and type safety violations
- [ ] Add core unit and integration test files
- [ ] Refactor/decompose large files and functions
- [ ] Fix file watcher cleanup and memory leaks

### Sprint 2 (HIGH)

- [ ] Audit and enhance error handling, boundaries, and async coverage
- [ ] Improve IPC/data validation and file path security
- [ ] Optimize React performance and begin bundle splitting

### Sprint 3 (MEDIUM)

- [ ] Extract constants and standardize naming
- [ ] Document complex logic and architectural decisions
- [ ] Add performance monitoring as needed

### Sprint 4+ (Ongoing)

- [ ] Polish user-facing error messages and logging
- [ ] Remove obsolete code/files
- [ ] Improve accessibility and onboarding docs

## Rationale

This improvement plan integrates both code review perspectives, prioritizing production-readiness, maintainability, security, and long-term code quality. Addressing these areas will unblock production deployment and set the foundation for scalable, sustainable development.
